# OMOPDataQualityDashboard

**Introduction**

To start, let's define what a data quality check is. It can be characterized as an aggregated summary statistic computed from the dataset, against which a decision threshold can be applied to determine if the statistic meets the expected standard.
The quality assessments within our system adhere to the Kahn Framework , which provides a structured approach to evaluating data quality through a system of categories and contexts. To familiarize yourself with this framework, please refer to the provided [link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5051581/)
